        "Here are some best practices for getting the most out of Cerebras model variants:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Select the right model for your task**:\n",
        "   - Use Llama 3.3 70B for general-purpose tasks requiring high accuracy\n",
        "   - Use Qwen 3 Coder 480B for code generation, debugging, and technical tasks\n",
        "   - Use GPT-OSS-120B for open-source alternatives with strong performance\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Optimize your prompts**:\n",
        "   - Be specific and clear in your instructions\n",
        "   - Provide context when necessary\n",
        "   - Use examples to guide the model's output format\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Adjust temperature settings**:\n",
        "   - Lower temperature (0-0.3) for more deterministic, focused responses\n",
        "   - Higher temperature (0.7-1.0) for more creative, varied responses\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Consider token limits**:\n",
        "   - Be mindful of input and output token limits\n",
        "   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable chunks\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Leverage Cerebras speed**:\n",
        "   - Use streaming for real-time applications\n",
        "   - Batch requests when processing multiple items"

            "Classical computers use \"bits\" to store and process information. A bit is either a 0 or a 1, like a coin that's either heads or tails. These bits are used to perform calculations and operations, one step at a time.\n",

            "Imagine you have a combination lock with 10 numbers. A classical computer would try each number one by one, like 0, 1, 2, and so on. A quantum computer, with its qubits, can try all 10 numbers simultaneously, which makes it much faster for certain types of calculations.\n",

            "**Other key features:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Entanglement:** Qubits can be connected in a way that lets them affect each other, even if they're separated by large distances. This allows quantum computers to perform calculations that involve multiple qubits at the same time.\n",
            "2. **Quantum parallelism:** Quantum computers can perform many calculations simultaneously, thanks to the properties of qubits. This makes them potentially much faster than classical computers for certain tasks.\n",

            "1. **Cryptography:** Quantum computers can potentially break certain encryption codes, but they can also be used to create unbreakable codes.\n",
            "2. **Optimization:** Quantum computers can be used to optimize complex systems, such as logistics or financial models.\n",
            "3. **Simulation:** Quantum computers can simulate complex systems, like molecules or materials, which could lead to breakthroughs in fields like medicine and materials science.\n",

            "\n",
            "1.  The function `fibonacci(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth Fibonacci number.\n",
            "2.  It first checks if `n` is a non-negative integer. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n",
            "3.  The base cases are handled when `n` is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns 0 or 1, respectively.\n",
            "4.  For `n` greater than 1, the function initializes a list `fib` of size `n + 1` to store the Fibonacci numbers.\n",
            "5.  It then calculates the Fibonacci numbers using dynamic programming by iterating from `i = 2` to `n` and storing the sum of the two preceding numbers in `fib[i]`.\n",
            "6.  Finally, the function returns the nth Fibonacci number stored in `fib[n]`.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Time Complexity\n",
            "\n",
            "The time complexity of this function is O(n), as it involves a single loop that runs from 2 to n.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Space Complexity\n",
            "\n",
            "The space complexity is also O(n), as the function uses a list of size n + 1 to store the Fibonacci numbers.\n"
